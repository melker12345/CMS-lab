##TODO:
Home page should contain more promenant cards outlining some of the website i have developed.
Each card should have a image, title and a short description


*Home page cards*
These cards should be large and well styled.
I want them to be in a grid.
This grid is the layout of the grid 
(note the "staggered" layout of the cards! The first (1) card in this grid have "**" on the left,
and "******" on the right the next card have, "******" on the left then "**" on the right, and so on. )

Similar to the cards on the product page but bigger and more dominant cards. 
Each containing a picture, title and description.
 
If user click on one of these cards on the home page, that card should fade into a large centered modal that seamlessly playes the gif/video. (the modal should be the size of a A4 paper)
Onced clicked a video/gif should play(load in the background after all the content on the homepage have been loaded and rendered no media controlls just play). 
That show cases the projects in more detail.

Under this video/gif the "description" section should be larger that contains information about the features and challanges etc.

If a user simply hovers over the card it should play the gif/video but not change the size of the card (other then a nice scale 1.1 on hover (or something)).


So to restate i want a grid of large cards each with image, title, description (like the once on projects page).
The grid should have a staggered style to alternate between aligning left, right.

upon hover transition the image into the video/gif in the image frame (prehaps scale the card by 1.1 upon hover).

on click transition the card into an A4 sixed centered modal that displays a larger video/gif area with an expanded descrioption of the project.
ofcourse should have a "close modal"-button but also support <Esc> and click outside the modal to close it
